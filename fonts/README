Fonts (as in Music fonts, not text used for lyrics etc) was introduced in v2.20, and is documented here:

  http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.20/Documentation/notation/replacing-the-notation-font

To get most of these scores printed, you will need to install the Paganini font in lilypond's font
directory, which on Ubuntu is

  /usr/local/lilypond/usr/share/lilypond/current/fonts/

i.e.

sudo cp fonts/paganini/svg/* /usr/local/lilypond/usr/share/lilypond/current/fonts/svg/
sudo cp fonts/paganini/otf/* /usr/local/lilypond/usr/share/lilypond/current/fonts/otf/
